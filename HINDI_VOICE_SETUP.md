# How to Install Hindi Voice for Windows

Your AI video generator is working correctly - it's generating Hindi text, but Windows doesn't have Hindi voices installed.

## Steps to Install Hindi Voice:

### Method 1: Windows Settings (Easiest)
1. Open **Settings** (Win + I)
2. Go to **Time & Language** → **Speech**
3. Click **"Add voices"** under "Manage voices"
4. Search for **"Hindi (India)"** or **"हिन्दी (भारत)"**
5. Click **Install** and wait for download
6. Restart your browser
7. Try the video again - it should now speak in Hindi!

### Method 2: Language Settings
1. Open **Settings** → **Time & Language** → **Language**
2. Click **"Add a language"**
3. Search for **"Hindi"**
4. Select **"Hindi (India)"** 
5. Click **Next** → **Install**
6. After installation, go to **Speech** settings
7. The Hindi voice should now be available
8. Restart browser

### Method 3: Use Google Chrome with Cloud Voices
- Chrome on Android/Windows 10+ has better voice support
- Some Chrome versions can use cloud-based voices for Hindi

## Alternative: Use Romanized Text

If you can't install Hindi voices, I can modify the app to:
- Generate script in Hindi (Devanagari)
- BUT use transliterated/Romanized Hindi (Latin script) for audio
- Example: "Namaste doston, aaj hum baat karne ja rahe hain..."

This way English voices can pronounce it (though accent won't be perfect).

Would you like me to add this romanization option?
